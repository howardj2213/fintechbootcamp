# FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system founded in 2012 by Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen, and Arthur Britto. A real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system is a type of funds transfer system 
that allows for money or securities to be transferred from one bank to another without a waiting period. Ripple was created to address some of Bitcoin's early limitations. 
Early in Bitcoin's history, before there was a set price for Bitcoin, a user would have to download the client and entire blockchain before they were able to use Bitcoin. 
This process would take several days. Stefan Thomas, the former Ripple CTO, was looking for a way to do cryptography in a web browser, instead of your local machine. 
This would allow Bitcoin to be more accessible and have mass appeal. According to Stefan Thomas, "we wanted to optimize for security, performance and the basic functionality."

Ripple is a privately funded company that initially went through five rounds of funding from investors, and is currently funded through the sales of its cryptocurrency XRP. 
Its initial funding totalled at $296 million. Ripple also offeres several professional services that provide financial network operators that ability to integrate with Ripple. 
As of now, XRP has a market cap of $25.01 billion.

## Business Activies

As a global based settlements network, Ripple seeks to replace SWIFT. SWIFT is the interbank messaging platform used by almost every bank in the world for securely sending and 
receiving financial transaction information. Ripple also provide a cryptocurrency, XRP, that allows for cross-border payments via a decentralized blockchain technology that allow 
transactions to in 3-5 seconds. These transcaction are faciliated on their XRP ledger, which allows for fast and cheap currency transfers. 

## Landscape

In the FinTech space, XRP and Ripple Labs fit into several different domains. As a payment protocol it is in payments/billing. With their cryptocurrency XRP, Ripple is a blockchain
and cryptocurrency solution. Ripple also is the only cryptocurrency that is currently used commercially, and provides enterprise solutions for companies globally. With such a robust 
list of service offerings, their competitors are just as varied. XRP is the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap - Bitcoin is the largest, followed by Ethereum.



## Results


Measuring Ripple's impact on the financial services industry as whole is difficult to do. One thing we can look at is the fact the XRP is the only cryptocurrency currently being used
commercially. As a cryptocurrency, it is the 3rd largest cryptocurrency by market cap, with a current market cap of $25.01 billion. Two core metrics that XRP has been trying to improve
for cryptocurrencies and fund transfers are settlement speed and transaction fees. True to its goal, XRP has been able to keep transaction settlement times EXTREMELY low. transactions
are currently being settled in an average time of 3.94 seconds. For perspective, Bitcoin and Ethereum - the top two cryptos by market cap - settle in 9.6 minutes and 6 minutes respectively. 
Ripple network transaction fees are roughly $0.000062 USD. Typical wire transfer fees are $15 domestically incoming, $25 domestically outgoing, and $45 internationally outgoing.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Ripple should create a product for esports gambling. Esports is currently on the rise, and many games have global appeal. With the bases of XRP being a way to instantly transfer 
money across borders, this would allow for easy transfer of winnnings between not only cross-platform players (xbox vs pc vs playstation), but also make international competition easier.  
Ripple would need to partner with platforms that have their own currency (example vBucks in Fortnite) to create an exchange rate for each game, but other than that, this could fit neatly into 
their current business model.
